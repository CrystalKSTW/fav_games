        <h1>1.Clash of Clans</h1>
        <p class="coc_intro">  Clash of Clans is a 2012 free-to-play mobile strategy video game developed and published by Finnish game developer Supercell. 
        The game was released for iOS platforms on August 2, 2012, and on Google Play for Android on October 7, 2013.
        The game is set in a fantasy-themed persistent world where the player is a chief of a village. 
        Clash of Clans tasks players to build their own village using the resources gained from attacking other player's villages; earning rewards, buying them with medals or by producing them at their own village. 
        To attack, players train different kinds of troops using resources. The main resources are gold, elixir and dark elixir. 
        Players can conjoin to create clans, groups of up to fifty people, who can then participate in Clan Wars together, donate and receive troops, and chat with each other.</p>

        <h3>My Opinions</h3>
        <p>Clash of clans is really fun to play and also interesting. <br>
            I've been playing this for over five years and I will continue playing. <br>
            Most people say "Playing a game for too long is boring".It may be right for <br>
            others but not to me.When you are in a good active clan, you will not feel boring. <br> Especially in war,
            everytime when you have to fill a star for winning, <br>
             in that moment you will feel one of the most exciting feeling ever. <br>
            It is not hard to play but hard to win every base.

        <h1>2. PUBG</h1>
        <p class="coc_intro"> PUBG: Battlegrounds (previously known as PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, or simply PUBG) 
            is a free-to-play online multiplayer battle royale game developed and published by PUBG Studios,a subsidiary of Krafton. 
             The game is based on previous mods that were created by Brendan "PlayerUnknown" Greene for other games, 
             inspired by the 2000 Japanese film Battle Royale, and expanded into a standalone game under Greene's creative direction. 
             In the game, up to one hundred players parachute onto an island and scavenge for weapons and equipment to kill others while avoiding getting killed themselves. 
             The available safe area of the game's map decreases in size over time, directing surviving players into tighter areas to force encounters. 
             The last player or team standing wins the round.</p>
